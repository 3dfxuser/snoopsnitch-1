Building from source
--------------------

SnoopSnitch - including helper binaries - is known to build sucessfully on
Linux and OS X. When using the prebuilt helper binaries contained in the
repository, the app may also build on Windows.

To build SnoopSnitch you need the Android SDK [1] for building the actual app
and the Android NDK [2] to build the native components like the Qualcomm DIAG
wrapper or the GSM parser. Download SDK and NDK and install it somewhere in
your file system. Set the environment varialbe NDK and SDK to the respective
paths:

	$ export ANDROID_HOME=<your_sdk_dir>
	$ export NDK_DIR=<your_ndk_dir>

As SnoopSnitch ships with prebuilt binaries, the following step is optional. To
build the parser binary from source, the ant packages are required:

	$ sudo apt-get install ant default-jdk

In the SnoopSnitch source directory do the following:

	$ cd contrib/
	$ ./compile.sh -t android -g -u

To build the app, in the SnoopSnitch source directory do the following:

	$ cd SnoopSnitch
	$ ant debug

Please please consult the Android documentation on how to set up the tools and
perform a release build.
