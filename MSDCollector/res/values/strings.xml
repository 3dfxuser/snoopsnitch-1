<string name="alert_networktest_message">
The active network test collects security information about your current
mobile network by sending and receiving a number of SMS and by placing and
receiving a number of automatic calls. It is normal to receive error
status SMS from your operator during that test.\n
\n
The test should be free of charge. HOWEVER, YOUR OPERATOR MAY CHARGE YOU FOR
OUTGOING SMS EVEN IF SENT TO AN INVALID DESTINATION!\n

\n
YOU MUST ONLY ENTER YOUR OWN PHONE NUMBER IN THE NEXT DIALOG. DO NOT PICK
UP THE PHONE WHEN THE SERVER CALLS. IF YOU DO SO, YOUR NUMBER WILL GET
BLACKLISTED AND BANNED FROM OUR SERVICE.\n
</string>

<string name="alert_networktest_privacy_disclaimer">
Following the test, the resulting radio data is uploaded to our servers
automatically. If you do not agree with this, press Cancel now and disable
recording for active tests in the settings menu.\n

SnoopSnitch collects and analyzes mobile radio data to make you aware
of your mobile network security and to warn you about threats like fake base

This application uses data contributed by other users. By choosing to upload your
measurement results or security events, you can help improve this data base and
support future research.\n
\n
SnoopSnitch will ask for confirmation whenever any of your information is uploaded to
