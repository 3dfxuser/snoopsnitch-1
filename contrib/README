To build the native part of the app (GSM parser and required libraries), invoke
the compile script with an Android base directory and an output directory
specified, e.g.:

$ NDK_DIR=~/Devel/android-ndk-r10b ./compile.sh build_dir

The result of the build is put into <build_dir>/parser. The ./prebuilt
directory contains a checked-in binary version of parser and libraries. Note,
that this directory is not updated automatically by the build process. The
files in <build_dir>/parser need to be copied to ./prebuilt and checked in
manually.
